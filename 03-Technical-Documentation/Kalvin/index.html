Objective: Build an app that is functionally similar to https://technical-documentation-page.freecodecamp.rocks. Do not copy this demo project.

User Stories:

    You can see a main element with a corresponding id="main-doc", which contains the page's main content (technical documentation)
    Within the #main-doc element, you can see several section elements, each with a class of main-section. There should be a minimum of five
    The first element within each .main-section should be a header element, which contains text that describes the topic of that section.
    Each section element with the class of main-section should also have an id that corresponds with the text of each header contained within it. Any spaces should be replaced with underscores (e.g. The section that contains the header "JavaScript and Java" should have a corresponding id="JavaScript_and_Java")
    The .main-section elements should contain at least ten p elements total (not each)
    The .main-section elements should contain at least five code elements total (not each)
    The .main-section elements should contain at least five li items total (not each)
    You can see a nav element with a corresponding id="navbar"
    The navbar element should contain one header element which contains text that describes the topic of the technical documentation
    Additionally, the navbar should contain link (a) elements with the class of nav-link. There should be one for every element with the class main-section
    The header element in the #navbar must come before any link (a) elements in the navbar
    Each element with the class of nav-link should contain text that corresponds to the header text within each section (e.g. if you have a "Hello world" section/header, your navbar should have an element which contains the text "Hello world")
    When you click on a navbar element, the page should navigate to the corresponding section of the #main-doc element (e.g. If you click on a .nav-link element that contains the text "Hello world", the page navigates to a section element with that id, and contains the corresponding header)
    On regular sized devices (laptops, desktops), the element with id="navbar" should be shown on the left side of the screen and should always be visible to the user
    Your technical documentation should use at least one media query

Fulfill the user stories and pass all the tests below to complete this project. Give it your own personal style. Happy Coding!

                        DM is a programming language for the creation of multi-user worlds. By ‘world’ I mean
                    a virtual multi-media environment where people assume personae through which they interact
                    with one another and computer-controlled objects. DM is used to run what is essentially a game engine, a bunch of softwares bundled together
                    As a whole, we refer to this collection of software as BYOND, which stands for Build Your Own Net Dream–an apt description of its
                    purpose and also of how far it has wandered <em>beyond</em> our original plans. But that is another
                    story! Below are the tree main programs that makes up BYOND:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Dream Seeker (The Client)</li>
                    <li>Dream Daemon (The Server)</li>
                    <li>Dream Maker (The Compiler)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Every introduction to a programming language must begin with the same example. Call
                    it destiny, inevitability, or pure chance; it is rather uncanny that the name of the universal
                    introductory example is hello world. Spooky, no? That’s exactly what happens in this example–
                    we say hello to the world.                
                </p>
                <pre><code>
                    mob
                        Login()
                            world << "Hello, world!"
                </code>
                </pre>
                <p>
                        If you have any prior programming experience, the last line probably looks vaguely sensible.
                    It outputs the text inside the double quotes to the whole world. But what on earth is a mob
                    and why is each line indented like stair-steps? All in good time. For now, simply understand
                    that the player’s avatar in the game is a mob. When a player logs in, the server is instructed to
                    output the message “Hello, world” to everybody.

                    A DM program begins at the root of the tree and descends along multiple branches. Each
                    branching point (or node) is given a name to distinguish it from the other branches at the same
                    level. Names are case-sensitive (so apple and Apple are different). They may be any length and
                    may contain any combination of letters, numbers, and underscores as long as they do not start
                    with a number. 
                </p>
                <p>Consider the following code:</p>
                <pre>
                <code>
                    turf
                        trap
                            pit
                            quicksand
                            glue
                </code>
                </pre>
                <p>
                        Several types of traps are defined (though no instructions have been included to actually
                    make them work). Here, each type of object is on a line by itself and indentation is used
                    to define the relationships between them. The three siblings pit, quicksand, and glue are all
                    children of trap, which is in turn derived from turf, the map terrain object.

                    BYOND makes uses of other languages in developing in its language, Such as database back-end languages such as:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>SQL</li>
                    <li>DDL</li>
                    <li>DML</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Also, considering the way BYOND displays UI's through web browsers. front-end languages such as:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>HTML</li>
                    <li>CSS</li>
                    <li>JavaScript</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Are all quite commonly used within the framework of BYOND as a whole.
                </p>
                </code>
            </section>
            <section class="main-section" id="Formatting_The_Code">

                <p> 
                    DM provides some flexibility in the way code is formatted. For example, blank lines may be
                    inserted between other lines without effect. This may help code from getting too dense and
                    unreadable.
                </p>
                <p> 
                    To compress code that is overly spread out, a semicolon may be used in place of a newline.
                    In this way, several children may reside on the same line. To put a parent and child on the same
                    line, a slash is used. It is equivalent to a newline followed by an additional level of indentation.
                    The following code is equivalent to the previous example:
                </p>
                <pre>
                    <code>
                        turf
                            trap
                                pit
                                quicksand
                                glue
                    </code>
                    </pre>
                <p>
                    in addition, braces may be used to mark the beginning and ending of a node’s children.
                    C, C++, and Java programmers may feel more at home using this style. With the compiler
                    checking both braces and indentation, it is hard for simple mistakes to slip through unnoticed.
                    Sometimes it is the simple spelling and typesetting errors which are the hardest to see.
                    Here is yet another encoding of the same objects, this time using braces:
                </p>
                <pre>
                    <code>
                        turf/trap
                        {
                            pit
                            quicksand
                            glue
                        }
                    </code>
                    </pre>
            </section>
            <section class="main-section" id="Code_Comments">
                <header><h1>Code Comments</h1></header>
                <p> 
                    When you start writing code as confusing and tangled as the last example, it would be a good
                    idea to leave a few clues behind. Otherwise you may find it incomprehensible the next time you
                    visit, a rather embarrassing situation. There are two ways to write comments in the code. One
                    is for multi-line comments and the other is for single line ones. Example:
                </p>
                <pre>
                    <code>
                        /*
                            This is a multi-line comment.
                            You can put whatever you want inside of it.
                            The compiler just skips right over.
                            Some of you may recognize it as a C style comment.
                        */
                        This is a single-line comment.
                        Some people know of it as the C++ style comment.
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <p>
                    Comments can occur anywhere in the code–at the end of lines, on lines by themselves, or
                    wherever. They are often used to make statements of intent or purpose. It frequently takes only
                    a very short note to make code much easier to read.
